# Overview

The js-triam-base library is the lowest-level triamnetwork helper library. It can be used in a browser or in node.js. It is mainly used to read, create and
sign [transactions](https://stellar.org/developers/learn/concepts/transactions.html). This library is used and exposed by
[js-triam-sdk](https://github.com/triamnetwork/js-triam-sdk) but you can use it by itself if you don't need to communicate with Horizon.
